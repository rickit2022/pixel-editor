# Core Functionality
We have so far implemented the following functionality in our program:

- Opening and closing files
- Saving in a compressed format
- Autosaving
- Resizing the canvas
- Drawing on, erasing, and clearing the canvas
- Changing the colour and thickness of the currently selected tool
- Draggable circle, square shaped drawing tool
- Lightening and darkening the colour of pixels
- Switching between the Pen tool and Eraser tool by clicking on Mouse Button 2 (Scroll Wheel Button)
- Exporting to different image formats

The functionality of these tools is generally identical to how the function in the paint program on Windows.
